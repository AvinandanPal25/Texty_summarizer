  "An Extractive Approach for Automatic Text Summarization using Machine Learning Technique"
--------------------------------------------------
Introduction: Automatic text processing is a research field that is currently extremely active. One important task in this field is automatic summarization , which consists of reducing the size of a text while preserving its information content. In this paper, the automatic summarization task is addressed. Recent research works on extractive-summary generation employ some heuristics, but few works indicate how to select the relevant features. This project presents the whole procedure based on the application of trainable Machine Learning algorithms which employ a set of features extracted directly from the original text.
  Automatic document summarization is a proper direction to reduce the tedious process of understanding every document, which makes people understand the main concept of an article faster. Automatic summarization is the process of reducing a text Document with a computer program in order to create a summary that retains the most important points of the original document.
  Summarization can be done is two ways. Extractive and Abstructive summarization. Extractive methods aim to select the most important set of sentences from the original document as summary. Therefore, the way to solve the problem is by finding a ranking function for each sentence in a document, and then stich together the top ranked sentences together. On the other hand, abstractive summarization methods generate a whole new summary after understanding the topic of the original document.
