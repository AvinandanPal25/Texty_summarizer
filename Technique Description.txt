A complete description of the technique used in this project for generating the Summary.

Step1: Processing the Input String, that includes the following steps namely,---
       (a) case-lowering, (b) Contraction Removal, (c) Punctuation Removal, (d) Tokenization, (e) Stop Words Removal, (f) Lemmatization
    
Step2: Selecting the most impactful lines: Six Factors for determining this.
        1. TF-IDF value (sk)
        ----> TF(Term Freq): No. of occurrences of a term in an Article/ Total no. of terms in that article,
        ----> DF(Document Freq): No. of sentences in which the term is present/ Total no. of sentences,
    
        2. Sentence length based Importance (sw) Calculation:--
        ----> The higher/ lower is the no. of words in a functions, higher will be s_rl (sentence relative length), 
        And lower will be the sw value.
        
        3. Importance on the basis of Line position (pk):-- 
        ----> The starting sentences and ending sentences will get the highest importance. 
        And the values gradually decreases, as it gets the  middle-most position.

        4. Sentence similarity score (ss):--
        ----> The first and the last sentence of a piece is the most important lines is an article.
        This factor is to determine the most similar sentences wrt the first and the last sentence.
        cosine_simalrity is calcualated for each sentences with the 1st and the last sentences, and then avg is taken.
         
        5. Importance on the basis of presencen of Proper Noun (pn):--
        ----> Proper nouns are important in any article, as the lines containing them.. generally bears important details
        related to the article. Hence presence of NNP and NNPS are determined.
         
        6. Importance on the basis of presencen of Indicators (in):--
        ----> Indicators are those words or combo of words that generally are used while telling about something imp. or
        while drawing a conclusion. e.g. 'To conclude', 'Finally', 'recently', 'in spite of' etc.

Step3: ADDing all three determining Parameters to get a aggregate ranking_score

Step4: Creating the Summary with a constraint in the Word-count ---> some% of word-count of the actual input text.
       Untill the count is exceeded, new sentences are added. If a current sent has more words than the empty space, next sent is considered
